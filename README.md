Random Performance
=================
This is a small Go-Lang performace test.

I use this as a demo of how to use and not use different Collections, Maps and other data structures.

Try it!

- Generate 10 000 000 random integers between 1 and 20 000 000. 
- No duplicates allowed in the final result
- Count the numner of duplicates genereated during the run.

This is written in Go-Lang but can easily be written in any language. All with significant difference in runtime depending on the datastructure used.
